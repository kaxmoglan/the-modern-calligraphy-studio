# The Modern Calligraphy Studio
### A fully user-editable e-commerce solution, complete with a wholesale customer section including individual accounts, pricing, shipping options and minimum order values.

I designed the site in Adobe XD and, upon approval, built a Wordpress theme using PHP, Sass, Javascript and the Bootstrap grid, compiled using Laraval Mix and Node.js. All customers are able to log in with fully styled gateways and redirects based on their account type, sign up to Mail Chimp mailing lists with bespoke sign-up forms and AJAX calls (so there are no redirects to Mail Chimp), and payment gateways that never leave the site.

I also used some freely available plugins for additional features like minimum order quantities per user-role and wholesale pricing.
